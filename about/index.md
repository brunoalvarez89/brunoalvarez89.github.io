Thanks for stopping by!

I am Bruno, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am currently a PhD student at the Universidad Nacional de San Mart√≠n, in Buenos Aires, where I develop neural network models to predict the immune response in mammals.

I have always had a passion for computers. I still remember how obsessed I was with aSCII art back in the 90's. Later on, I stumbled upon science and research, and both worlds sticked together until today.

This site was created with the intent of sharing my walkabouts on math and code. Its name tries to capture the sense of wander I get when researching interesting subjects (also codewanderer.com was already registered :P).

See you around!
