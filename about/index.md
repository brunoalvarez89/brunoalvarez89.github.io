Thanks for stopping by!

I am Bruno, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am currently a PhD student at the Universidad Nacional de San Mart√≠n, in Buenos Aires, where I develop neural network models to predict the immune response in mammals.

I have always had a passion for computers. I still remember my obsession with [mIRC scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC_scripting_language) and [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) back in the 90's. Back then, a perfect evening loked something like this:

Later on, I stumbled upon science and research, and both worlds sticked together until today.

### The Code Roamer
I created this site with the intent of sharing my walkabouts on math and code. Its name tries to capture the sense of wander I get when diving into subjects that really interest me (also codewanderer.com was already registered :P).
